# 🕹️ Interactive Prototyping Case Study: Minecraft Memory Game UI

This project is an **Interactive Prototyping Case Study** showcasing core principles of **UI/UX design and Front-End Development** through the creation of a classic memory game inspired by the iconic Minecraft aesthetic.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal was to transform a familiar aesthetic (the iconic Minecraft pixel art) into a highly usable and engaging interface for a classic memory game. The design focus was placed on two key UX aspects:

1.  **Clear Feedback:** Providing immediate visual responses to user actions, such as card flips, successful matches, and errors.
2.  **Visual Communication:** Adapting a visually dense, pixel-based art style into a simplified interface that remains readable and reduces cognitive load.


## 🛠️ Technology & Skills

* **UI/UX:** Design Strategy, Interaction Flows, Visual Language Adaptation.
* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (used for game logic and DOM manipulation).
