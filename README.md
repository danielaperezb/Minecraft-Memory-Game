# 🕹️ Interactive Prototyping Case Study: Minecraft Memory Game UI

This project is an **Interactive Prototyping Case Study** that demonstrates core principles of **UI/UX Design** and Front-End development.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal was to transform a familiar aesthetic (the iconic Minecraft pixel art) into a highly usable and engaging interface for a classic memory game. The design focus was placed on two key UX aspects:

1.  **Clear Feedback:** Ensuring immediate visual feedback upon user interaction (card selection, matching success, errors).
2.  **Visual Communication:** Adapting a complex visual style (pixel art) into a clean, functional interface that reduces cognitive load.

## 🛠️ Technology & Skills

* **UI/UX:** Design Strategy, Interaction Flows, Visual Language Adaptation.
* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (used for game logic and DOM manipulation).
